# Gibbs-Algorithm
In statistical mechanics, the Gibbs algorithm, introduced by J. Willard Gibbs in 1902, is a criterion for choosing a probability distribution for the statistical ensemble of microstates of a thermodynamic system by minimizing the average log probability.For more details go through this [Wiki Page](https://github.com/bmmrock9/Gibbs-Algorithm/wiki).
